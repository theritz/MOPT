Many Options Push-To for dobsionian telescopes

Attempt at something bigger:

present tiny form to select celestial object;
scrape coordinates of celestial object;
scrape information of celestial object;
pull DSS image of celestial object;
present those things in a mobile web-app;
...with a shiny GUI;
read out a magnetometer for Altitude and rotary sensor for Azimuth;
provide Push-To directions in the mobile web-app to direct user to celestial object;
optional: make it look good ^_^

But I'll start with:
present basic tiny form to select celestial object;
scrape coordinates of celestial object;
scrape information of celestial object;
pull DSS image of celestial object;
present those things in a very basic web-page w/o attention to cosmetics ^_^;
And take it from there....
